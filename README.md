# My Devlog - Building a Game with Rust and Bevy

This is my personal devlog website, (And by first application) built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), where I journal the challenges and experiences I face while building a game using Rust and the Bevy engine. The purpose of this site is to document my learning process, share insights, and track progress as I dive into game development.

## Project Overview

The main features of this devlog include:
- Regular updates about my game development journey.
- Topics covering Rust, Bevy, and general game design.
- Built using **SvelteKit** for fast and lightweight performance.
- Styled with simple, clean designs for readability.

## Current Features

## Future Plans

- **Login Page**: Allow users to login and subscribe to posts. As well as let admins log in and create posts
- **Game Demos**: Embedding or linking game demos to show progress in real-time.
- **Comments Section**: Allow readers to engage and ask questions.
- **Code Snippets**: Include specific coding solutions that I found useful.
